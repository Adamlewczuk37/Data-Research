# Data Science/Research
This repository showcases the development of an interactive graphing interface in Python for my research at the USC Biomedical Simulations Resource Center. For this project, my code takes in a .csv output from the lab's simulation software that predicts drug concentrations throughout the human body over time and outputs an interactive interface with self-formatting graphs that is capable of plotting any combination of input data. 
The first file is the final product which utilizes Dash to create an interactive interface with the necessary functional elements, dropdowns, and graphing.
The second file showcases the initial code of the project which formatts and manipulates the Excel file using Pandas and plots the data with all needed capabilities using Plotly. 

This repository showcases the first time I did scripting in Python. All of this work was done with the oversight of Professor David D'Argenio at USC.
